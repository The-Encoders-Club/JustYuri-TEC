            y "Essentially a set of core ideas and properties necessary for someone or something to be as they are."

            y "This is part of one of the main ideas of the school of thought called Stoicism."
            y "Namely the concept of things that we do control and those we cannot control."
            y "For instance, relationships, the economy, our health, and most other external things are out of our control."
            y "We can do all we can to influence them in our favor but in the end, how these things end up are not up to us."
            y "For example, we can make the right investments into the market but there have been times where, for many reasons, the economy takes a massive downturn."
            y "Or there have been cases where even the most healthy people with all the right choices still would come down with a severe illness, seemingly out of nowhere."
            y "You can make all the right choices to positively influence people you bond with but in the end, they may still choose to move on and leave you for their own reasons."
            $show_chr("A-ACAAA-AAAA")
            y "But there are still certain things you can control: our actions, our opinions, and our position we take towards the outside world and circumstances."
            y "For instance, say you were afflicted with a terminal illness. Medications, treatments and all methods can be tried but there is no guarantee."
            y "However how you choose to take the situation can be controlled. For instance, one can accept the situation as is, including the risk of death, and do with it anyway."
            y "With this realization and the determination to make the best of what you have before the supposed end, one can have a calm logical mind that makes good decisions."
            y "Thus chances of recovery can be further increased even more."
            $show_chr("A-ACAAA-ALAL")
            y "Additionally stoicism also offers various ways to gain inner peace, especially important in our hectic modern world in my opinion."
            y "For instance, the concept of negative visualization, which was developed by an ancient emperor says we should imagine the negative scenarios to come beforehand."
            y "This can help us better steel ourselves mentally for these situations, for example, negative confrontations with difficult people."
            y "Then there is the concept of memento mori, which focuses on the mortality of life. Life is short and with the limited time we have, we should focus on the truly important things in life."
            y "Whilst at the same time we don't need to worry too much and take life too seriously."
            y "Then there is the 'view from above' which lets us see ourselves from a cosmic point of view. That indeed we are relatively small and insignificant in this vast endless universe..."

label idle_108: # Imagining a Goth Literature Club (Expanded Wardrobe)
    $show_chr("A-ACAAA-ALAA")
    y "You know, [player], I've been letting that thought about a 'Goth Literature Club' percolate in my mind... and it's become far more elaborate."
    y "I realized that assigning just one style to each of us was far too simplistic. People are complex; their self-expression would be, too. So, I started imagining a whole... wardrobe of possibilities for everyone."
    $show_chr("A-BCBBA-AMAM")
    y "For Sayori, beyond just Pastel Goth, I could see her in Soft Goth. Using comfortable, oversized sweaters and muted colors to create a cozy, protective shell... it speaks to her vulnerability."
    y "Bubble Goth, with its brighter, almost pop-art influences, would suit her energetic moments."
    y "An Ethereal Wave or Dream Pop influence would perfectly match her more poetic, bittersweet side, flowing fabrics, a dreamy, distant look... like her 'Bottles' poem."
    y "And perhaps even Whimsigoth, with its celestial patterns and velvet textures, for her more whimsical, daydreaming nature."
    y "Or even Strega fashion, with its layered, natural, almost 'forest witch' aesthetic, representing a deeper, more hidden connection to the earth and her own tangled emotions."
    $show_chr("A-BDBBA-AMAM")
    y "Natsuki's fierce personality has so many outlets. Gothic Lolita is an obvious choice, combining her love for cute, frilly things with a dark, defiant edge."
    y "She could easily adopt the more mature, elegant Aristocrat style when she wants to be taken seriously."
    y "A Lite Punk Goth look would be her everyday casual wear, still rebellious, but less intense than pure Deathrock."
    y "Sweet Goth or 'Creepy Cute' would directly tie into her baking, using motifs of cupcakes and sweets alongside bats and skulls."
    y "And for moments of pure, assertive elegance, Rococo Goth, with its ornate, historical extravagance, would be a perfect, if surprising, fit for her."
    $show_chr("A-ACBBA-ALAA")
    y "Monika's role as the leader offers a fascinating range. We discussed Corporate and Nu-Goth, but Glam Goth also suits her perfectly."
    y "The confidence, the stage presence... it reflects her desire to be the center of attention."
    y "I could also see her in a sleek, futuristic Cyber Goth style, which feels... chillingly appropriate, given her true nature as a self-aware program in a digital world."
    y "A Dark Cabaret influence would speak to the theatrical, tragic performance she orchestrated for us all... that song she dedicated to you..."
    y "And on her more reserved days, a simple, sharp Minimalist Goth look would project an effortless, almost intimidating, sense of control."
    $show_chr("A-ABABA-AMAM")
    y "And for myself... while Romantic and Victorian styles feel like my foundation, I thought of others."
    y "Trad Goth, connecting back to the classic post-punk origins of the music, would suit my appreciation for history and authenticity."
    y "In my... more intense moments... perhaps even Deathrock, with its raw, horror-inspired aesthetic, could be a visceral outlet for the feelings I try to keep hidden."
    y "An Ethereal Wave style would suit my more introspective, quiet moods, draped in flowing, mysterious fabrics."
    y "And... there's the Dark Academia aesthetic. It's not technically goth, but it's so closely related... the focus on classic literature, knowledge, and a melancholic mood... it feels like a perfect description of my inner world."
    $show_chr("A-BFAAA-ALAA")
    y "It's a rather... extensive fantasy, I know. But it feels like a more complete way of understanding them. Of seeing all their different facets through a different lens."
    y "Thank you for letting me get lost in thought again, [player]."
